HackerNews is an open-source HN app.

## About
- ðŸ’™ **Written in Flutter**
- ðŸ“˜ **Utilizes Riverpod for state management**
- ðŸ“± **Tested on both Android and iOS**

## Packages Used
- ðŸ“¦ **Riverpod**: For state management
- ðŸ“¦ **Dio**: For network calls and caching
- ðŸ“¦ **Flutter Widget from HTML**: For rendering HTML texts
- ðŸ“¦ **URL Launcher**: To open URLs
- ðŸ“¦ **Infinite Scroll Pagination**: For endless scrolling
- ðŸ“¦ **Connectivity Plus**: To monitor network connectivity
- ðŸ“¦ **Google Fonts**: For custom typography
- ðŸ“¦ **Shimmer**: For loading indicators

## Features
The app has two main pages:
1. **Home Page**: Displays the top stories.
2. **User Page**: Shows a userâ€™s posts.

### Navigation
- Clicking on the **user** part of a post redirects to the **User Page**.
- Tapping on a **post** opens the URL of the post.

## Common Challenges with the HN API
1. **Slow loading when fetching posts**:
    - Used Flutterâ€™s `Future` for asynchronous calls. While this improved performance, it wasnâ€™t perfect.
    - Implemented **endless scrolling** to load more posts as the user reaches the bottom of the page.
